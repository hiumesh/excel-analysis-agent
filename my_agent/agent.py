    Create and compile the Excel Analysis Agent graph with intelligent LLM-based routing.

    NEW ARCHITECTURE:

    Workflow:
    1. START -> router_node (LLM classifies query)

    2. Router conditional routing:
       - "chat": Generic conversation -> chat_node -> END
       - "analysis": New analysis request -> check_data_context
       - "analysis_followup": Follow-up on previous analysis -> supervisor_node

    3. check_data_context (validates file_path):
       - If data_context missing OR file changed -> data_inspector_node
       - If data_context exists AND file matches -> supervisor_node

    4. data_inspector_node -> supervisor_node

    5. supervisor_node (evaluates if new code execution needed):
       - needs_analysis=True -> planning_node
       - needs_analysis=False -> followup_answer_node (answers from context)

    6. planning_node -> coding_subgraph -> END

    7. followup_answer_node -> END

    Key Features:
    - LLM-based query classification with structured output
    - Smart file path validation to skip redundant data inspection
    - Supervisor evaluates if analysis needed or can answer from context
    - Separate planning node for detailed analysis plans
    - Direct answer path for follow-up questions that don't need code
    - Coding subgraph isolation (tool calls don't leak to parent)
    - Artifact accumulation across analysis runs
    - Structured step tracking (TodoList pattern)

    The coding_subgraph is a nested graph that handles:
    - Code generation by the coding agent
    - Tool execution (Python REPL with matplotlib Agg backend)
    - Iteration and error handling
    - Final analysis compilation with structured artifacts
    - Step progress tracking
